This is a template for creating a Jetty based RESTful service web server.   To use the template simply clone the project as a starting point and then alter filenames and etc... accordingly.  Ensure that you also rename the items in the pom.xml to match your needs as this template uses maven.

The maven jetty commands can be found here: http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/jetty-maven-plugin.html 

Why did I create this?  
Because sometimes we don't want to use a heavy IDE like eclipse to work, but still want to be able to quickly have a template for doing projects/tests/challenges/etc...
